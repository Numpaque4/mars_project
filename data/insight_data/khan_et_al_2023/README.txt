These folders contain a subset of 1000 seismic models of Mars as shown in Figure 2 in the main text of 'Evidence for a liquid silicate layer atop the Martian core'. Note that the models also match the observed diffracted P-wave reverberation indicated in Figure 3.

All models contained in folder 'LSL_Models' are in txt format, and contain 7 columns with the following information: Depth[km], Vp[km/s], Vs[km/s], Rho[g/cm3], T[K], g[m/s2], P[Pa]. Note that the Temperature is set to nan below the mantle-LSL interface as it is not determined there.

All models contained in the folder 'LSL_Models_TauP' are in nd format and readable by TauP. For reasons of compatibility with TauP, each model file has a small inner core with seismic parameters set to specific values entirely unrelated to the inversion results. THE PRESENCE OF AN INNER CORE IS NOT A RESULT OF THE INVERSION. S-wave velocities in the Liquid Silicate Layer are set to 0.001 km/s for compatibility with TauP, since layers outside the core cannot be 'entirely' fluid, i.e., 0 km/s.

The core compositions in the inset of Figure 4 in the main text of 'Evidence for a liquid silicate layer atop the Martian core' are provided in 'Core.zip', which contains two folders: 1) 'Compositions.txt' and 2) an accompanying set of 59 core density and P-wave velocity profiles (e.g., 'Profile_number.txt'), where 'number' refers to the number in the first column of the file 'Compositions.txt'. The density profiles are those shown as coloured lines (yellow--magenta) in Figure 4. The file 'Compositions.txt' consists of 7 columns arranged as follows: model number, S, O, C, H, Fe, and Ni contents in wt%. The files 'Profile_number.txt' consist of three columns: depth from the CMB, density, and P-wave velocity. Note that the core density and P-wave velocity profiles provided here have been computed using the equation-of-state approach described in the Methods section of the main text and have not been derived directly from inversion of the seismic data (dark blue lines in Figure 4 of the main text).
